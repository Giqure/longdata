## Project

### create

Project is created with `next.js` with app route.
`Next.js` is based on `react`.

Project uses `next-auth` to implement signin function, `prisma` as ORM to connect `mySQL` and `tailwind` CSS.

Based on `TS`. Chinese.

### structure

Most function (`live` `feedback` and default page) shared the same layout in `(defaultRoot)`. Only `file` use a different layout. `Sign In` generally created by `Next-Auth`.

Files managed by `file` is storaged in `app/data/file`.

This project created in a enviroment which is called longdatd so its called longdata. It storaged in (Linux)`/www/`, so you can see if the absoulte path is used, it will be `/www/longdata/`.

### function

#### live

Receive stream by rtmp://SERVERIP:1935/live, and show all streams in `/live`.

Also a tutorial using OBS as example at `file/turtorial` (just spelling mistake).
